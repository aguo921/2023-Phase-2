# Datasets

Choose *one* dataset as your chosen classification dataset and *one* dataset as your chosen regression dataset from the list below.

You may not use other datasets, as these datasets have been chosen by the MSA team for the following reasons:
- They are clean enough for anyone to get started with while not being completely unusable due to data quality issues
- They are small enough for anyone to analyse and run models with on their own devices
- Keeping the list of datasets small allows us to mark students fairly and compare student's work across submissions to ensure that students are getting the credit they deserve, or implement scaling procedures if needed
- Keeping the list of datasets small allows you to work within creative constraints and focus on your analysis and modelling skills, as opposed to dealing with issues pertaining to specific datasets or work with datasets you may have already used in the past

Please note:
- Some features contain column headers such as Var_1 that don't make it clear what data in those columns mean. You don't need to guess what those columns inherently mean, you can simply refer to those columns by their headers when doing anything with data in those columns as part of the tasks to help you understand their purpose and effect on the target variable (e.g. looking for distinct categories, numerical values, patterns, or relationships/correlations of those columns with other variables).
- The details of the scenarios described below are fictional.

## Classification

### Credit Risk (credit_risk.csv)

With the price of housing and groceries rising due to inflation, increasing numbers of people are looking to banks for borrowing money. Of course, nothing comes from free and banks expect their borrowers to pay their money back with interest. Some borrowers may be less likely to do so in a timely manner, so banks are looking to budding data scientists like yourselves to create machine learning models that can accurately predict which borrowers would be risky to give credit to and which ones would not (i.e. a binary classification problem).

### Market Segmentation (market_segmentation.csv)

A car company wants to enter new markets with their existing cars. Their own market research has shown that customers within markets they are currently operating in fall into one of four groups (A, B, C, D) based on their similar characteristics, and that each of these groups have been shown targeted ads and messaging to buy their cars, which has worked exceptionally for the company. They now want to employ this strategy in new markets using data that they've collected (via ethical means, of course) about potential customers by segmenting them into the same four groups (i.e. a multi-class classification problem).

## Regression

### Data Salaries (data_salaries.csv)

Within the world of data, there are specialisations such as data engineer, machine learning engineer, data analyst, and many more. How much these jobs pay depend on a variety of factors. Your task is to predict the salary of a data-related job given certain information about it.

### Exam Scores (exam_scores.csv)

This dataset includes scores from three test scores of students at a public school and a variety of personal and socio-economic factors that may be interrelated. Note that this dataset contains three possible targets: math score, reading score, and writing score. You may choose to predict one, two, three, or a combination of these targets.
